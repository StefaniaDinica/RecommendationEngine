2. articles_community.csv

![df_content overview](/assets/df_content.png)

## Instructions:
Open `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook and run each cell.

There are also some tests that should pass if nothing changes.

## Types of recommendation strategies

1. **Rank-Based recommendations**

Recommending the top articles, irrespective of the user.

2. **User-user based collaborative filtering**

Recommend to a user the articles read by similar users.

3. **Content based recommendations**

Recomend to a user articles that have similar titles with the articles he has read.

## Matrix factorization

Perform SVD matrix factorizarion on the training set and predict values for the test set.

## Observations:

See `requirements.txt` before using this project, so that there won't be dependecy problems.
